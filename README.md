# Practice project
<p> These problems can be used for practicing basic concepts in programming using primarily C++ </p>
<ul>
	<li> Problem 1: Count the number of vowels in a given word, return to prompt after result for next word</li>
	<li> Problem 2: Count the number of characters in a file, skip spaces and newline character in total count</li>
	<li> Problem 3: Generate a random number between 0 and 100, ask player to guess the secret number,provide hints "that's too high" or "that's too low"</li>
	<li> Problem 4: Take as input - prices of horses, dogs and cats, total money spent and total animal bought and than estimate individual counts. There could be many solutions so print all of theme</li>
	<li> Problem 5: Tank Battle Game - show user the distance of current enemy tank, ask for angle to shoot at, give suggestions like problem 3, at the end give user option to continue or report the total number of kills (fix max shots to 10 per tank) </li>
</ul>
<p> Similar problems can commonly be found in textbooks and tutorials, you are supposed to work on these yourself and use the solution as reference only </p>
