# Practice project
<p> These problems can be used for practicing basic concepts in programming using primarily C++ </p>
<ul>
	<li> Problem 1: Count the number of vowels in a given word, return to prompt after result for next word</li>
	<li> Problem 2: Count the number of characters in a file, skip spaces and newline character in total count</li>

</ul>
<p> The problems are commonly suggested in coding practice books and online tutorials, you are supposed to work on them yourself and use the solution as reference only </p>
